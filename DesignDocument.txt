Here's our design document

So originally this was going to be a Breakout game, but it turned out being a Pong type game.
You move the top bar with A and D, and the bottom with the Left and Right Arrow Keys.
The core mechanic is that you don't want to die - by reaching the bottom or the top.
Ben did all of the artwork you see, along with code for collisions and various other things.
I did code for movement, spawning, and other things - I think we worked well together as a team!
